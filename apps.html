					<p>Studies have shown that for each extra second that it takes for a page to load conversion rates fall by 12%.</p>
					<p>Conversely, a load time improvement from 4 to 2 seconds results in an average revenue increase of 3.2%.</p>

					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Reduce Image Size but Maintain Quality</h3>
					<p>Using either our lossy or lossless compression technology you can reduce your image size with either minimal or no quality loss.</p>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Retain 30 Day Image Backups</h3>
					<p>You can easily compare your optimized images with the originals inside the app.</p>
					<p>If you are not happy with how an image has been compressed you can restore it to the original within 30 days.</p>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Optimize your Code and Improve Your Themeâ€™s Loading Time</h3>
					<p>Code optimizations allow a customerâ€™s browser to read and process your shopâ€™s code more efficiently.</p>
					<p>Available Code Optimizations:</p>
					<ul class="ml-5">
						<li>Available Code Optimizations:</li>
						<li>CSS Minification</li>
						<li>JS Minification</li>
						<li>JS Inlining</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The minification process removes unnecessary items, such as whitespace and developer comments, from your code as it is being read by the browser. The items that are removed do not affect how your pages appear and function.*</p>
					<p>Inlining works by taking files that are normally loaded from separate URLs and inserts the file content directly into your HTML. This reduces the total number of download requests made by the browser.*</p>
					<p>*These code optimizations are non-destructive, so it wonâ€™t change your existing code. If you need to edit any of your code it will look the same as it always has. Additionally, if you choose to turn off the optimizations your code will return to being processed as it originally was.</p>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Track Improvements</h3>
					<p>Your personalised Plug in Speed dashboard will help you track all the optimizations that have been made and how they have improved the speed of your shop.</p>
					<p>Speed Optimization Metrics:</p>
					<ul class="ml-5">
						<li>PageSpeed Score</li>
						<li>Average Load Time</li>
						<li>Average Image Size</li>
						<li>Size Reduction for each Image</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Minimal Maintenance Required</h3>
					<p>After the initial setup, all images will be optimized automatically.</p>
					<p>Changes to your code can be easily manually optimized inside your settings with one click.</p>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Get Started</h3>
					<ol class="ml-5">
						<li>Sign up for Plug in Speed</li>
						<li>Choose your settings</li>
						<li>Wait for your optimizations to be implemented</li>
						<li>View the improvements made to your shop</li>

					<p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) uses a standard survey format that asks customers to rate their experience with your shop by responding to the following question:</p>
					<p>- How likely are you to recommend this shop to a friend or colleague?</p>
					<p>There is then an option for the customer to provide a more detailed explanation of their score.</p>
					<p>This survey method has become an industry standard and is widely recognized as one of the best ways to collect consistent and strong customer feedback.</p>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Collect Your NPS Score and Customer Comments</h3>
					<p>Your total Net Promoter Score will be calculated and displayed on your Plug in NPS dashboard.</p>
					<p>You can also easily view color-coded ratings and comments from individual customers. You can link from customer comments on Plug in NPS to your customerâ€™s profile inside your Shopify admin.</p>
					<p>How NPS is Calculated:</p>
					<ul class="ml-5">
						<li>Customers who provide a rating of 9-10 are â€˜promotersâ€™</li>
						<li>Customers who provide a rating of 7-8 are â€˜passivesâ€™</li>
						<li>Customers who provide a rating of 6 or less are â€˜detractorsâ€™</li>
						<li>Net Promoter Score = percentage of promoters - percentage of detractors</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Make Informed Business Decisions</h3>
					<p>Since NPS is a standardized method you can compare your NPS score with external benchmarks in your industry. This allows you to see how your shop is performing relative to your competition.</p>
					<p>Customer comments can give you valuable insights into what your shop is doing well and what could be improved. Proactively listening to and reacting to customer feedback can help you improve sales and build brand loyalty.</p>

			        <p>Plug in Backup will automatically backup your shopâ€™s published theme every hour.</p>
			        <p>You can rest assured that any changes to your theme will be saved and any problems that arise can easily be undone.</p>
			        <h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Track Changes to Your Theme with a Clear Version History</h3>
			        <p>Each time changes are detected in your theme a new version will be created automatically.</p>
			        <p>You can track the time that new version was created and the number of changes that were made to your theme.</p>
			        <h3 class="my-4 h3-apps">Take Control by Creating Additional Manual Versions</h3>
			        <p>At any time you can make an additional version of your theme manually.</p>
			        <p>You can add custom notes to these backups to help you track of key changes to your theme.</p>
			        <p>We recommend creating manual versions before and after installing a new app or having a developer edit your code.</p>
